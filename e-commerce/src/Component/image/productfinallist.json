      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div> <br /> <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div> <br /> <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

Join Joel, a ruthless survivor with few moral lines left to cross, who lives in one of the last remaining Quarantine Zones. These walled-off, oppressive cities are run by what's left of the military.

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

      "The PS3 system is now slimmer and lighter than ever before. While the form factor may have changed, the PS3 system still comes with free access to the PlayStation Network, built-in Wi-Fi, and hard disk drive storage for games, music, videos, and photos. Plus, the PS3 system is the only gaming console with a Blu-ray player to give you the best high-definition viewing experience on your television. With five times the capacity of standard DVDs, Blu-ray discs gives you more realistic and immersive gameplay that can only be possible on the PS3 system with games such as Gran Turismo 5, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Game of the Year, and MAG.  All PlayStation 3 systems are already equipped with everything you need to play stereoscopic 3D games."

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

Join Joel, a ruthless survivor with few moral lines left to cross, who lives in one of the last remaining Quarantine Zones. These walled-off, oppressive cities are run by what's left of the military.

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

      "The PS3 system is now slimmer and lighter than ever before. While the form factor may have changed, the PS3 system still comes with free access to the PlayStation Network, built-in Wi-Fi, and hard disk drive storage for games, music, videos, and photos. Plus, the PS3 system is the only gaming console with a Blu-ray player to give you the best high-definition viewing experience on your television. With five times the capacity of standard DVDs, Blu-ray discs gives you more realistic and immersive gameplay that can only be possible on the PS3 system with games such as Gran Turismo 5, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Game of the Year, and MAG.  All PlayStation 3 systems are already equipped with everything you need to play stereoscopic 3D games."

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div> <br /> <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div> <br /> <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

Not sure what Azurite is? Azurite is a deep blue carbonate mineral produced by the weathering of copper ore deposits. While the mineral may be unstable in open air causing it to lose color over time, the PlayStation 3 Azurite Blue 250GB System is anything but unstable. Boasting an impressive 250GB hard drive that can hold up to 1800 games, 140 movies, 99,000 songs, or a mixture of all. We think it is safe to say you wont be grinding this system up for pigment any time soon. Azurite is the color of your new PlayStation 3 system, are we right?"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

Not sure what Azurite is? Azurite is a deep blue carbonate mineral produced by the weathering of copper ore deposits. While the mineral may be unstable in open air causing it to lose color over time, the PlayStation 3 Azurite Blue 250GB System is anything but unstable. Boasting an impressive 250GB hard drive that can hold up to 1800 games, 140 movies, 99,000 songs, or a mixture of all. We think it is safe to say you wont be grinding this system up for pigment any time soon. Azurite is the color of your new PlayStation 3 system, are we right?"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div> <br /> <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div> <br /> <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "Step onto the field and immerse yourself in the excitement of next-gen action with Fifa 14 for the PS4. EA Sports' new Ignite Engine places you right in the heart of real-world stadiums, with dynamic 3D crowds that organically react to live game situations. With Pro Instincts, players on the field change their actions according to the environment, using improved artificial intelligence to anticipate and counter your every move. The new Elite Technique feature improves on gameplay mechanics with more player movement and skills. Trap the ball using all parts of your body and attack the net with natural off-balance shots. Or plant, pivot, and shoot your way to glory by channeling your inner Messi to take on all challengers!"

Boasting an impressive 250GB hard drive that can hold up to 1800 games, 140 movies, 99,000 songs, or a mixture of all. We think it is safe to say you wont be grinding this system up for pigment any time soon. Azurite is the color of your new PlayStation 3 system, are we right?"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

Not sure what Azurite is? Azurite is a deep blue carbonate mineral produced by the weathering of copper ore deposits. While the mineral may be unstable in open air causing it to lose color over time, the PlayStation 3 Azurite Blue 250GB System is anything but unstable. Boasting an impressive 250GB hard drive that can hold up to 1800 games, 140 movies, 99,000 songs, or a mixture of all. We think it is safe to say you wont be grinding this system up for pigment any time soon. Azurite is the color of your new PlayStation 3 system, are we right?"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div> <br /> <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div> <br /> <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

Join Joel, a ruthless survivor with few moral lines left to cross, who lives in one of the last remaining Quarantine Zones. These walled-off, oppressive cities are run by what's left of the military. Despite the strict martial law, Joel operates in the black market of the city, smuggling contraband for the right price.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header1\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"><ul id=\"list0inner\"><li>With over 40 perfect scores, The Last of Us is one of the greatest games made - Only On PlayStation</li><li>Developed by Naughty Dog, creators of the best-selling Uncharted series</li><li>Genre-defining experience that blends survival and action elements</li><li>Character driven story about a population decimated by a modern plague</li><li>The PlayStation 3 system includes a free PlayStationNetwork account for online gaming, streaming movies and music, and access to the PlayStation Store. -Internet Access Required</li></ul></div>  <h5><div id=\"header2\">The Last of Us</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The Last of Us is a third-person Survival-Action game that utilizes choices in gameplay action to develop the game storyline, as well as the relationship between the two main characters, Joel and Ellie. The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

Boasting an impressive 250GB hard drive that can hold up to 1800 games, 140 movies, 99,000 songs, or a mixture of all. We think it is safe to say you wont be grinding this system up for pigment any time soon. Azurite is the color of your new PlayStation 3 system, are we right?"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

While the mineral may be unstable in open air causing it to lose color over time, the PlayStation 3 Azurite Blue 250GB System is anything but unstable. Boasting an impressive 250GB hard drive that can hold up to 1800 games, 140 movies, 99,000 songs, or a mixture of all. We think it is safe to say you wont be grinding this system up for pigment any time soon. Azurite is the color of your new PlayStation 3 system, are we right?"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5> <div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text0\"> <p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p> </div> <div class=\"two-third-col\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text1\"> <p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text2\"> <p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header3\">Squads</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text3\"> <p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p> </div> <h5> <div id=\"header4\"></div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text4\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\"> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" /></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"></div> <h5> <div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div> </h5> <div class=\"a-spacing-small\" id=\"text5\"> <p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p> </div> <br /> <h5> <div id=\"header6\"></div> </h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

Join Joel, a ruthless survivor with few moral lines left to cross, who lives in one of the last remaining Quarantine Zones. These walled-off, oppressive cities are run by what's left of the military. Despite the strict martial law, Joel operates in the black market of the city, smuggling contraband for the right price.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header1\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"><ul id=\"list0inner\"><li>With over 40 perfect scores, The Last of Us is one of the greatest games made - Only On PlayStation</li><li>Developed by Naughty Dog, creators of the best-selling Uncharted series</li><li>Genre-defining experience that blends survival and action elements</li><li>Character driven story about a population decimated by a modern plague</li><li>The PlayStation 3 system includes a free PlayStationNetwork account for online gaming, streaming movies and music, and access to the PlayStation Store. -Internet Access Required</li></ul></div>  <h5><div id=\"header2\">The Last of Us</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The Last of Us is a third-person Survival-Action game that utilizes choices in gameplay action to develop the game storyline, as well as the relationship between the two main characters, Joel and Ellie. The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

      "The PS3 system is now slimmer and lighter than ever before. While the form factor may have changed, the PS3 system still comes with free access to the PlayStation Network, built-in Wi-Fi, and hard disk drive storage for games, music, videos, and photos. Plus, the PS3 system is the only gaming console with a Blu-ray player to give you the best high-definition viewing experience on your television. With five times the capacity of standard DVDs, Blu-ray discs gives you more realistic and immersive gameplay that can only be possible on the PS3 system with games such as Gran Turismo 5, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Game of the Year, and MAG.  All PlayStation 3 systems are already equipped with everything you need to play stereoscopic 3D games."

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Visit Los Santos with The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Visit Los Santos: a sprawling metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap cable TV, in the PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a street hustler looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31922fZaEeL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/314-WdMODTL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Los Santos and Blaine County</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The largest open world yet in a Grand Theft Auto title, spanning vastly diverse cultural and geographical areas - the entire world of Grand Theft Auto V is open from the very beginning of the game to explore. Visitors to the greater metropolis of Los Santos and the countryside of Blaine County will encounter faded celebrities, party people, hikers, bikers, and every other manner of colorful denizen. You'll be able to traverse everywhere from the tops of the mountains, through the streets of Los Santos and to the depths of the ocean floor.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Michael, Franklin and Trevor</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Three playable protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor may live in different parts of town, have their own issues, attitudes, lifestyles, desires and goals - but they do know how to work together. They also each have their own unique skillsets to bring to the table when it's time to get the job done.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Heists</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Petty crimes, hustling, and stealing cars can only get you so far in Los Santos. To score big, Michael, Franklin and Trevor will work together to pull off grand Heists - big, multi-part missions that require careful preparation, recruiting, and precise (and often explosive) execution. Cash is king in GTAV and while there will be plenty of ways to acquire and spend it - heists are the way to earn the big bucks.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\">'Recreational' Activity</div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The open world of Grand Theft Auto V is not just massive in scale, but will offer more to get into than ever before. For recreation, play a bit of golf or tennis, zen out with some yoga or cycle through the countryside. For adrenaline heads, parachute over the city, or customize your Cheetah and take it to the streets to race suckers for money. Or earn cash the old fashioned way, by taking it - whether by ripping off liquor stores or by buying and taking over businesses that will earn you dividends. Even minding your own business having a stroll you may meet one of Los Santos' weirdos or starlets and find yourself off on a wild misadventure you never expected.</p></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31A-ydMqcXL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>The PlayStation 3 Grand Theft Auto V Bundle features a black PlayStation 3 system featuring a massive 500GB hard drive which holds up to 3750 games, 297 movies, 198,437 songs, and 80,000 photos.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

Join Joel, a ruthless survivor with few moral lines left to cross, who lives in one of the last remaining Quarantine Zones. These walled-off, oppressive cities are run by what's left of the military.

The game features a combination of combat, exploration, stealth and platforming game mechanics. Although Joel and Ellie are both residents of a post-apocalyptic world, they have had different experiences that affect the way they see the world around them, and feel about what they see and do. Joel had a life before the pandemic, while the world of the pandemic is all that Ellie has ever known. As part of Joel's job to smuggle Ellie out of the quarantine zone, players have to make choices in how they deal with enemies, which include, roving gangs of human scavengers not unlike themselves, military elements and infected civilians.</p></div> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Players also have an opportunity to interact together with elements of the world around them, which helps to build the bond between Joel and Ellie. Resources in the game are scarce, making overwhelming use of firepower unlikely and unwise in conflicts, and resource gathering missions. In addition, most other residents of the ruined world that are encountered are just trying to survive - blurring the line between good guys and bad guys. Finally, game AI react differently depending on the specifics of the player's actions, making choice in gameplay a major consideration.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">The Last of Us: Left Behind</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Also coming soon is The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC where Ellie returns as new light is shed on her relationship with Riley, her best friend from the military boarding school they both grew up in. After inexplicably disappearing for weeks, Riley reemerges in Ellie’s life with a surprising revelation. The two sneak out of their school for the last time, leading to a series of events that will forever change both of their lives.</p></div> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> <div class=\"break\"></div> </div>"

      "The PS3 system is now slimmer and lighter than ever before. While the form factor may have changed, the PS3 system still comes with free access to the PlayStation Network, built-in Wi-Fi, and hard disk drive storage for games, music, videos, and photos. Plus, the PS3 system is the only gaming console with a Blu-ray player to give you the best high-definition viewing experience on your television. With five times the capacity of standard DVDs, Blu-ray discs gives you more realistic and immersive gameplay that can only be possible on the PS3 system with games such as Gran Turismo 5, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves Game of the Year, and MAG.  All PlayStation 3 systems are already equipped with everything you need to play stereoscopic 3D games."

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "Step onto the field and immerse yourself in the excitement of next-gen action with Fifa 14 for the PS4. EA Sports' new Ignite Engine places you right in the heart of real-world stadiums, with dynamic 3D crowds that organically react to live game situations. With Pro Instincts, players on the field change their actions according to the environment, using improved artificial intelligence to anticipate and counter your every move. The new Elite Technique feature improves on gameplay mechanics with more player movement and skills. Trap the ball using all parts of your body and attack the net with natural off-balance shots. Or plant, pivot, and shoot your way to glory by channeling your inner Messi to take on all challengers!"

Pac and his 2 best friends, Spiral and Cylindria, rise to the challenge of protecting their home, in a big, bustling, bonkers world of action, adventure, and just plain wackiness.

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

Play as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Toad—each with their own special skills—in the all-new Sprixie Kingdom. Scamper up walls with the new cat power-up to find secrets or pounce from above to claw enemies. Enjoy a solo romp or add friends on the fly for instant Mario multiplayer* magic!</p> <p>Freely roam the world map and each sprawling stage alone or team up with friends to find hidden stars while competing to take the crown for most coins and points found.

      "<div class=\"aplus\"> <h5><div id=\"header0\">Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched.</div></h5> <div id=\"text0\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.</p></div> <div class=\"two-third-col\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image0\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313KzKorf3L.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image1\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qJgKmg8vL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <h5><div id=\"header1\">Single Player Campaign</div></h5> <div id=\"text1\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header2\">Multiplayer</div></h5> <div id=\"text2\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header3\">Squads</div></h5> <div id=\"text3\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.</p></div> <h5><div id=\"header4\"></div></h5> <div id=\"text4\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"></div> </div> <div class=\"third-col last\">  <div class=\"leftImage\" style=\"width: 300px;\"> <div id=\"image2\"><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vtpqIpllL.jpg\" alt=\"\"  ></div> </div> <div class=\"break\"> </div> <h5><div id=\"header5\">Extinction</div></h5> <div id=\"text5\" class=\"a-spacing-small\"><p>A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.</p></div> <br> <h5><div id=\"header6\"></div></h5> <div id=\"list0\"></div> </div> </div>"

      "Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life. <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V is the largest and most ambitious game Rockstar Games has yet created, and takes full advantage of every ounce of processing power available in the current generation of consoles.  In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on the Xbox 360.  <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs. <br /> <br />This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive (sold separately) with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance. "
