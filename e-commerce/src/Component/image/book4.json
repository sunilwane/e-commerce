      "<DIV><p><B>For Kids Aged 10+ (And Their Parents)</B><br><br></p><p><b>The code in this book runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, even an OLPC laptop or Raspberry Pi!</b></p><p>Python is a powerful, expressive programming language that's easy to learn and fun to use! But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that's no fun for anyone.</p><p><i>Python for Kids</i> brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side.</p><p>Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you'll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more.</p><p>As you strike out on your programming adventure, you'll learn how to:</p> <ul><li>Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps</li> <li>Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules</li> <li>Use control structures like loops and conditional statements</li> <li>Draw shapes and patterns with Python's turtle module</li> <li>Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter</li> </ul><p>Why should serious adults have all the fun? <i>Python for Kids</i> is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming.</p></div>"

      "This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that's no fun for anyone.</p><p><i>Python for Kids</i> brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side.</p><p>Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you'll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more.</p><p>As you strike out on your programming adventure, you'll learn how to:</p> <ul><li>Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps</li> <li>Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules</li> <li>Use control structures like loops and conditional statements</li> <li>Draw shapes and patterns with Python's turtle module</li> <li>Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter</li> </ul><p>Why should serious adults have all the fun? <i>Python for Kids</i> is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming.</p></div>"

      "This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

      "<DIV><p><B>For Kids Aged 10+ (And Their Parents)</B><br><br></p><p><b>The code in this book runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, even an OLPC laptop or Raspberry Pi!</b></p><p>Python is a powerful, expressive programming language that's easy to learn and fun to use! But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that's no fun for anyone.</p><p><i>Python for Kids</i> brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side.</p><p>Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you'll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more.</p><p>As you strike out on your programming adventure, you'll learn how to:</p> <ul><li>Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps</li> <li>Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules</li> <li>Use control structures like loops and conditional statements</li> <li>Draw shapes and patterns with Python's turtle module</li> <li>Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter</li> </ul><p>Why should serious adults have all the fun? <i>Python for Kids</i> is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming.</p></div>"

      "This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

      "<DIV><p><B>For Kids Aged 10+ (And Their Parents)</B><br><br></p><p><b>The code in this book runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, even an OLPC laptop or Raspberry Pi!</b></p><p>Python is a powerful, expressive programming language that's easy to learn and fun to use! But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that's no fun for anyone.</p><p><i>Python for Kids</i> brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side.</p><p>Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you'll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more.</p><p>As you strike out on your programming adventure, you'll learn how to:</p> <ul><li>Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps</li> <li>Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules</li> <li>Use control structures like loops and conditional statements</li> <li>Draw shapes and patterns with Python's turtle module</li> <li>Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter</li> </ul><p>Why should serious adults have all the fun? <i>Python for Kids</i> is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming.</p></div>"

      "This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

      "In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

      "THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

      "<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

      "For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

      "When starfighter pilot Simon Dodds is enrolled in a top secret military project, he and his wingmates begin to suspect that there is a lot more to the theft of a legendary battleship and an Imperial nation's civil war than either the Confederation Stellar Navy or the government are willing to let on.<br /><br />Within weeks of being reassigned to the Confederate border system of Temper, the five would begin to untangle a web of lies and a cover-up that seemed to span the length of the entire galaxy. And it would not be long before they themselves would come face to face with that which destroyed an empire: an unforgiving, unstoppable, and totally unrelenting foe.<br /><br />There seemed to exist only one glimmer of hope of driving back the darkness: The ATAF Project - a secretly developed set of starfighters that may well just harbour some terrible secrets of their own.<br /><br />Reviews:<br /><br />\"A tightly plotted action-adventure yarn with a good mix of likeable, interesting and nasty characters\" <br /><br />\"Written with perspicacity and drive, with a strong voice and good attention to detail.\"<br /><br />124,000 words<br />~ 450 pages"

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.

      "Over a century after the seedship Lazarus completed its near 1,200 year journey, the Terran colonies found themselves in conflict with a hostile alien race.<br />In a world decimated by a long, drawn-out war where a never-ending stream of fresh clones are fed to the Terran war machine, a genetically engineered squad of soldiers must fight to survive against all odds.<br />When society is ruled from behind the scenes by massive corporate conglomerates that control powerful secret organizations and even the very Republic itself, the clones will come to question the world they live in, their fellow soldiers, and even the very nature of their existence. What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him.

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.

Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

      "Thousands of them have lived underground. They've lived there so long, there are only legends about people living anywhere else. Such a life requires rules. Strict rules. There are things that must not be discussed. Like going outside. Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

There are things that must not be discussed. Like going outside. Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"

      "Over a century after the seedship Lazarus completed its near 1,200 year journey, the Terran colonies found themselves in conflict with a hostile alien race.<br />In a world decimated by a long, drawn-out war where a never-ending stream of fresh clones are fed to the Terran war machine, a genetically engineered squad of soldiers must fight to survive against all odds.<br />When society is ruled from behind the scenes by massive corporate conglomerates that control powerful secret organizations and even the very Republic itself, the clones will come to question the world they live in, their fellow soldiers, and even the very nature of their existence. What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

And it would not be long before they themselves would come face to face with that which destroyed an empire: an unforgiving, unstoppable, and totally unrelenting foe.<br /><br />There seemed to exist only one glimmer of hope of driving back the darkness: The ATAF Project - a secretly developed set of starfighters that may well just harbour some terrible secrets of their own.<br /><br />Reviews:<br /><br />\"A tightly plotted action-adventure yarn with a good mix of likeable, interesting and nasty characters\" <br /><br />\"Written with perspicacity and drive, with a strong voice and good attention to detail.\"<br /><br />124,000 words<br />~ 450 pages"

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.

      "Over a century after the seedship Lazarus completed its near 1,200 year journey, the Terran colonies found themselves in conflict with a hostile alien race.<br />In a world decimated by a long, drawn-out war where a never-ending stream of fresh clones are fed to the Terran war machine, a genetically engineered squad of soldiers must fight to survive against all odds.<br />When society is ruled from behind the scenes by massive corporate conglomerates that control powerful secret organizations and even the very Republic itself, the clones will come to question the world they live in, their fellow soldiers, and even the very nature of their existence. What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

There are things that must not be discussed. Like going outside. Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

      "Thousands of them have lived underground. They've lived there so long, there are only legends about people living anywhere else. Such a life requires rules. Strict rules. There are things that must not be discussed. Like going outside. Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"

What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"

      "Over a century after the seedship Lazarus completed its near 1,200 year journey, the Terran colonies found themselves in conflict with a hostile alien race.<br />In a world decimated by a long, drawn-out war where a never-ending stream of fresh clones are fed to the Terran war machine, a genetically engineered squad of soldiers must fight to survive against all odds.<br />When society is ruled from behind the scenes by massive corporate conglomerates that control powerful secret organizations and even the very Republic itself, the clones will come to question the world they live in, their fellow soldiers, and even the very nature of their existence. What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him.

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.

      "Commander Jonathan Radec is a man desperately trying to escape from the mistakes of his past.  <br /><br />Now the owner of Vanguard Shipping, his primary concerns are trying to keep his ships flying and his crew alive.  However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

      "Thousands of them have lived underground. They've lived there so long, there are only legends about people living anywhere else. Such a life requires rules. Strict rules. There are things that must not be discussed. Like going outside. Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"
