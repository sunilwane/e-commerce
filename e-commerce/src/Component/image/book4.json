But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that's no fun for anyone.</p><p><i>Python for Kids</i> brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side.</p><p>Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you'll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more.</p><p>As you strike out on your programming adventure, you'll learn how to:</p> <ul><li>Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps</li> <li>Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules</li> <li>Use control structures like loops and conditional statements</li> <li>Draw shapes and patterns with Python's turtle module</li> <li>Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter</li> </ul><p>Why should serious adults have all the fun? <i>Python for Kids</i> is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming.</p></div>"

      "This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

      "Want to learn computer programming but aren't sure where to start? Programming for the Absolute Beginner provides a gentle learning curve in programming for anyone who wants to develop fundamental programming skills and create computer programs. The primary focus is on teaching the reader how to program using a free implementation of BASIC called Just BASIC. As such, the book focuses on developing programs that run on Microsoft Windows, but also presents programming principles that apply to different environments, including other operating systems and the Internet. Additionally, the book provides a solid foundation for advancing to different programming languages as you gain confidence in your newly acquired programming abilities.

But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that's no fun for anyone.</p><p><i>Python for Kids</i> brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side.</p><p>Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you'll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more.</p><p>As you strike out on your programming adventure, you'll learn how to:</p> <ul><li>Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps</li> <li>Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules</li> <li>Use control structures like loops and conditional statements</li> <li>Draw shapes and patterns with Python's turtle module</li> <li>Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter</li> </ul><p>Why should serious adults have all the fun? <i>Python for Kids</i> is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming.</p></div>"

      "This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that's no fun for anyone.</p><p><i>Python for Kids</i> brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side.</p><p>Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you'll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more.</p><p>As you strike out on your programming adventure, you'll learn how to:</p> <ul><li>Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps</li> <li>Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules</li> <li>Use control structures like loops and conditional statements</li> <li>Draw shapes and patterns with Python's turtle module</li> <li>Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter</li> </ul><p>Why should serious adults have all the fun? <i>Python for Kids</i> is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming.</p></div>"

      "This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that's no fun for anyone.</p><p><i>Python for Kids</i> brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side.</p><p>Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you'll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more.</p><p>As you strike out on your programming adventure, you'll learn how to:</p> <ul><li>Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps</li> <li>Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules</li> <li>Use control structures like loops and conditional statements</li> <li>Draw shapes and patterns with Python's turtle module</li> <li>Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter</li> </ul><p>Why should serious adults have all the fun? <i>Python for Kids</i> is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming.</p></div>"

      "This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

      "<DIV><p><B>For Kids Aged 10+ (And Their Parents)</B><br><br></p><p><b>The code in this book runs on almost anything: Windows, Mac, Linux, even an OLPC laptop or Raspberry Pi!</b></p><p>Python is a powerful, expressive programming language that's easy to learn and fun to use! But books about learning to program in Python can be kind of dull, gray, and boring, and that's no fun for anyone.</p><p><i>Python for Kids</i> brings Python to life and brings you (and your parents) into the world of programming. The ever-patient Jason R. Briggs will guide you through the basics as you experiment with unique (and often hilarious) example programs that feature ravenous monsters, secret agents, thieving ravens, and more. New terms are defined; code is colored, dissected, and explained; and quirky, full-color illustrations keep things on the lighter side.</p><p>Chapters end with programming puzzles designed to stretch your brain and strengthen your understanding. By the end of the book you'll have programmed two complete games: a clone of the famous Pong and \"Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit\"—a platform game with jumps, animation, and much more.</p><p>As you strike out on your programming adventure, you'll learn how to:</p> <ul><li>Use fundamental data structures like lists, tuples, and maps</li> <li>Organize and reuse your code with functions and modules</li> <li>Use control structures like loops and conditional statements</li> <li>Draw shapes and patterns with Python's turtle module</li> <li>Create games, animations, and other graphical wonders with tkinter</li> </ul><p>Why should serious adults have all the fun? <i>Python for Kids</i> is your ticket into the amazing world of computer programming.</p></div>"

      "This is the second edition of John Zelle's Python Programming, updated for Python 3. This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is used as the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, I have purposely avoided certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing. Features include the following: *Extensive use of computer graphics. *Interesting examples. *Readable prose. *Flexible spiral coverage. *Just-in-time object coverage. *Extensive end-of-chapter problems."

What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"

      "Over a century after the seedship Lazarus completed its near 1,200 year journey, the Terran colonies found themselves in conflict with a hostile alien race.<br />In a world decimated by a long, drawn-out war where a never-ending stream of fresh clones are fed to the Terran war machine, a genetically engineered squad of soldiers must fight to survive against all odds.<br />When society is ruled from behind the scenes by massive corporate conglomerates that control powerful secret organizations and even the very Republic itself, the clones will come to question the world they live in, their fellow soldiers, and even the very nature of their existence. What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

      "When starfighter pilot Simon Dodds is enrolled in a top secret military project, he and his wingmates begin to suspect that there is a lot more to the theft of a legendary battleship and an Imperial nation's civil war than either the Confederation Stellar Navy or the government are willing to let on.<br /><br />Within weeks of being reassigned to the Confederate border system of Temper, the five would begin to untangle a web of lies and a cover-up that seemed to span the length of the entire galaxy. And it would not be long before they themselves would come face to face with that which destroyed an empire: an unforgiving, unstoppable, and totally unrelenting foe.<br /><br />There seemed to exist only one glimmer of hope of driving back the darkness: The ATAF Project - a secretly developed set of starfighters that may well just harbour some terrible secrets of their own.<br /><br />Reviews:<br /><br />\"A tightly plotted action-adventure yarn with a good mix of likeable, interesting and nasty characters\" <br /><br />\"Written with perspicacity and drive, with a strong voice and good attention to detail.\"<br /><br />124,000 words<br />~ 450 pages"

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.

      "Over a century after the seedship Lazarus completed its near 1,200 year journey, the Terran colonies found themselves in conflict with a hostile alien race.<br />In a world decimated by a long, drawn-out war where a never-ending stream of fresh clones are fed to the Terran war machine, a genetically engineered squad of soldiers must fight to survive against all odds.<br />When society is ruled from behind the scenes by massive corporate conglomerates that control powerful secret organizations and even the very Republic itself, the clones will come to question the world they live in, their fellow soldiers, and even the very nature of their existence. What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome.

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

Their journey takes them to the far corners of the globe and into the secrets of their pasts. The Immari are close on their heels and will stop at nothing to obtain Kate's research and force the next stage of human evolution--even if it means killing 99.9% of the world's population.

The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

      "Thousands of them have lived underground. They've lived there so long, there are only legends about people living anywhere else. Such a life requires rules. Strict rules. There are things that must not be discussed. Like going outside. Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"

What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"

      "Over a century after the seedship Lazarus completed its near 1,200 year journey, the Terran colonies found themselves in conflict with a hostile alien race.<br />In a world decimated by a long, drawn-out war where a never-ending stream of fresh clones are fed to the Terran war machine, a genetically engineered squad of soldiers must fight to survive against all odds.<br />When society is ruled from behind the scenes by massive corporate conglomerates that control powerful secret organizations and even the very Republic itself, the clones will come to question the world they live in, their fellow soldiers, and even the very nature of their existence. What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him.

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.

      "Commander Jonathan Radec is a man desperately trying to escape from the mistakes of his past.  <br /><br />Now the owner of Vanguard Shipping, his primary concerns are trying to keep his ships flying and his crew alive.  However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

      "Thousands of them have lived underground. They've lived there so long, there are only legends about people living anywhere else. Such a life requires rules. Strict rules. There are things that must not be discussed. Like going outside. Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

      "Thousands of them have lived underground. They've lived there so long, there are only legends about people living anywhere else. Such a life requires rules. Strict rules. There are things that must not be discussed. Like going outside. Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"

What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

      "When starfighter pilot Simon Dodds is enrolled in a top secret military project, he and his wingmates begin to suspect that there is a lot more to the theft of a legendary battleship and an Imperial nation's civil war than either the Confederation Stellar Navy or the government are willing to let on.<br /><br />Within weeks of being reassigned to the Confederate border system of Temper, the five would begin to untangle a web of lies and a cover-up that seemed to span the length of the entire galaxy. And it would not be long before they themselves would come face to face with that which destroyed an empire: an unforgiving, unstoppable, and totally unrelenting foe.<br /><br />There seemed to exist only one glimmer of hope of driving back the darkness: The ATAF Project - a secretly developed set of starfighters that may well just harbour some terrible secrets of their own.<br /><br />Reviews:<br /><br />\"A tightly plotted action-adventure yarn with a good mix of likeable, interesting and nasty characters\" <br /><br />\"Written with perspicacity and drive, with a strong voice and good attention to detail.\"<br /><br />124,000 words<br />~ 450 pages"

      "The inhuman Rulers of the galaxy sent three fleets to learn what had happened to the world located by Captain North and the Survey Team he led. Neither a soul nor a message returned. The fourth time, the Rulers sent a single man: Nils Hansen.<br /><br />Commissioner Hansen had a mind that saw the shortest path to each task's completion and a ruthless determination to do what the task required. The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy. Now Hansen was being sent to penetrate a spacetime enigma which had made gods or demons of the first humans to discover it. He would succeed or die.<br /><br />Northworld: a place of slashing violence and mystic transformation<br />Northworld: a place of treachery and dazzling beauty<br />Northworld: a place of honor, of faith, and of love.<br /><br />Hansen's iron will and strong arm confront godlike power and godlike cunning while a galaxy trembles for the outcome. And if Hansen dies - he will not die alone!<br /><br />At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (DRM Rights Management)."

For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.

      "Over a century after the seedship Lazarus completed its near 1,200 year journey, the Terran colonies found themselves in conflict with a hostile alien race.<br />In a world decimated by a long, drawn-out war where a never-ending stream of fresh clones are fed to the Terran war machine, a genetically engineered squad of soldiers must fight to survive against all odds.<br />When society is ruled from behind the scenes by massive corporate conglomerates that control powerful secret organizations and even the very Republic itself, the clones will come to question the world they live in, their fellow soldiers, and even the very nature of their existence. What’s more, they must struggle to establish their own identities in a world that has little respect for human life, and even less for that of a clone."

However, the shadowy Syndicate organisation has set their sights on the Commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she’s become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend.  Recently elevated to President of the Confederation, she’s still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.<br /><br />Surrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he’s now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation – for which he has little regard.  Jon has little going in his favour, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.<br /><br />The Last Praetorian is a Science Fiction adventure/romance, which tries to answer the question: “Can you ever find redemption for the mistakes of your past?”"

The cost - to himself and whoever happened to be in the way - didn't matter. Hanson's Special Units had kept his planet safe from the most sophisticated and violent criminals in the galaxy.

      "The year is 2108, and the North American Commonwealth is bursting at the seams. For welfare rats like Andrew Grayson, there are only two ways out of the crime-ridden and filthy welfare tenements, where you're restricted to two thousand calories of badly flavored soy every day:<p>You can hope to win the lottery and draw a ticket on a colony ship settling off-world, or you can join the service.<p>With the colony lottery a pipe dream, Andrew chooses to enlist in the armed forces for a shot at real food, a retirement bonus, and maybe a ticket off Earth. But as he starts a career of supposed privilege, he soon learns that the good food and decent health care come at a steep price…and that the settled galaxy holds far greater dangers than military bureaucrats or the gangs that rule the slums.<p>The debut novel from Marko Kloos, <i>Terms of Enlistment</i> is a new addition to the great military sci-fi tradition of Robert Heinlein, Joe Haldeman, and John Scalzi."

Never mention you might like going outside.<br /><br />Or you'll get what you wish for.<br /><br /><br />What the press is saying:<br /><br />Boing Boing's Official Review: \"This story is terrific. I was completely immersed, watching Howey slowly paint a picture of a society gone wrong through the eyes and discovery of some truly compelling characters.\"<br /><br />Wired.com's Official GeekDad Review: \"Howey is among a growing list of authors who are making successful careers of publishing without the assistance of agents and traditional publishing houses. The traditional argument has been that if a book couldn’t find a publisher it probably wasn’t worth reading. However, just as iTunes changed how consumers found music and the way in which bands made their bread, ebook readers, and in particular the Kindle, are changing the ways in which authors find their readers and make a living. All of this means the old assumptions about indie books no longer hold true, and readers need to be prepared to adjust their expectations accordingly. The Wool Omnibus is a great book and deserves recognition as a full fledged contribution to the science fiction genre.\""

      "If you wish for peace, prepare for war.\r<br />-Royal Navy Motto\r<br />\r<br />Seventy years ago, the interstellar supercarrier Ark Royal was the pride of the Royal Navy.  But now, her weapons are outdated and her solid-state armour nothing more than a burden on her colossal hull.  She floats in permanent orbit near Earth, a dumping ground for the officers and crew the Royal Navy wishes to keep out of the public eye.  \r<br />\r<br />But when a deadly alien threat appears, the modern starships built by humanity are no match for the powerful alien weapons.  Ark Royal and her mismatched crew must go on the offensive, buying time with their lives  And yet, with a drunkard for a Captain, an over-ambitious first officer and a crew composed of reservists and the dregs of the service, do they have even the faintest hope of surviving ...\r<br />\r<br />... And returning to an Earth which may no longer be there?\r<br />\r<br />[Like my other self-published Kindle books, Ark Royal is DRM-free.  You may reformat it as you choose.  There is a large sample of the text – and my other books – on my site: chrishanger.net.  Try before you buy.]\r<br />"
