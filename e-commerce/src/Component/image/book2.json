      "In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

      "THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

      "<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

      "For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

      "Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

      "In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

      "THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

      "<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

      "For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

      "Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

      "In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

      "THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

      "<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

      "For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

      "Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

      "THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

      "<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

      "After 20 years in the test kitchen, we've discovered the best methods for approaching essential cooking techniques and a wide range of recipes. We also know what questions home cooks will have, and what problems they'll face. In this landmark project, we share everything we've learned, from simple knife skills and cookery fundamentals, such as whipping egg whites, to perfecting recipes like pepper-curated filets mignons and layer cakes. This is a book that will make anyone, no matter their skill level, a better cook. More than 3,000 step-by-step color photos and almost 200 cooking lessons show you how things should be done, and captions featuring the voice of the test kitchen tell you why. It's like having an expert by your side every step of the way, guaranteeing success and making you a more skilled cook at every turn."

      "For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

      "Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

      "In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

      "THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

      "<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

      "For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

      "Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

      "In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

      "THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

      "<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

      "For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

      "Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

      "In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

      "THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

      "<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

      "For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

      "Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

      "In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

      "THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

      "<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

      "After 20 years in the test kitchen, we've discovered the best methods for approaching essential cooking techniques and a wide range of recipes. We also know what questions home cooks will have, and what problems they'll face. In this landmark project, we share everything we've learned, from simple knife skills and cookery fundamentals, such as whipping egg whites, to perfecting recipes like pepper-curated filets mignons and layer cakes. This is a book that will make anyone, no matter their skill level, a better cook. More than 3,000 step-by-step color photos and almost 200 cooking lessons show you how things should be done, and captions featuring the voice of the test kitchen tell you why. It's like having an expert by your side every step of the way, guaranteeing success and making you a more skilled cook at every turn."

      "For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

      "Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

      "In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

      "THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

      "<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

      "For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

      "Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

      "In an era of outfitted home kitchens and food fascination, it's no wonder home cooks who never learned the fundamentals of the kitchen are intimidated. Twenty years ago, James Peterson could relate, and so he taught himself by cooking his way through professional kitchens and stacks of books, logging the lessons of his kitchen education one by one. Now one of the country's most revered cooking teachers, Peterson provides the confidence-building instructions home cooks need to teach themselves to cook consistently with ease and success. COOKING is the only all-in-one instructional that details the techniques that cooks really need to master, teaches all the basic recipes, and includes hundreds of photos that illuminate and inspire. <br><br>   • Cooking authority James Peterson's definitive, all-inclusive learn-to-cook cookbook. <br>   • 600 hard-working recipes everyone should know how to make-from the perfect roasted chicken to bouillabaisse and apple pie. <br>   • 1,500 instructional photos, showing exactly how recipes are made, teach food-literate novices to cook with confidence and more advanced cooks to expand their repertoire.<br>   • James Peterson has more than 1 million cookbooks in print."

      "THE REVOLUTIONARY BOOK THAT<br>BRINGS SCIENCE TO THE STOVE<br>Great cooks seem to operate on intuition. Watch one at work and you might think he or she must have a sixth sense that switches on in the kitchen. But great cooks aren t psychic. They simply understand the fundamental principles of cooking the unspoken rules that guide their every move in the kitchen. What s behind these principles? Science.<br>At America s Test Kitchen, we know something about that. The team at Cook s Illustrated has spent the past 20 years investigating every facet and every detail associated with home cooking through tens of thousands of kitchen tests. In The Science of Good Cooking, we distill the past two decades of this test kitchen work into 50 basic cooking concepts, ones that every home cook should know.<br>These concepts sound suspiciously simple: Gentle Heat Retains Moisture. Salty Marinades Work Best. Starch Helps Cheese Melt Nicely. Sugar Changes Sweetness and Texture. It turns out that these ideas are not only easy to understand but also easy to master. And don t worry there is no molecular gastronomy, liquid nitrogen, or fancy equipment involved. As always, our mission is squarely focused on great home cooking.<br>In addition to explaining how food science works (and why you should care), The Science of Good Cooking shows you the science. This book brings you into the test kitchen with 50 unique (and fun) experiments engineered to illustrate (and illuminate) the science at work. The experiments demonstrate why adding fat to your eggs will make the perfect tender omelet, why grinding your own meat will make the ultimate burger, and why you should have patience before carving your roast.<br>And because no concept is complete without recipes, The Science of Good Cooking includes more than 400 classic Cook s Illustrated recipes that take the science to the stove, putting the principles to work. The book offers a fresh perspective on everything from roasting a chicken to baking chocolate chip cookies. These are the fundamental recipes home cooks struggle to get right. And when these recipes are coupled with the simple science explaining how and why they work, the results are illuminating."

      "<div> <p>Are you the innovative type, the cook who marches to a different drummer -- used to expressing your creativity instead of just following recipes? Are you interested in the science behind what happens to food while it's cooking? Do you want to learn what makes a recipe work so you can improvise and create your own unique dish?</p> <p>More than just a cookbook, <em>Cooking for Geeks</em> applies your curiosity to discovery, inspiration, and invention in the kitchen. Why is medium-rare steak so popular? Why do we bake some things at 350 F/175 C and others at 375 F/190 C? And how quickly does a pizza cook if we overclock an oven to 1,000 F/540 C? Author and cooking geek Jeff Potter provides the answers and offers a unique take on recipes -- from the sweet (a \"mean\" chocolate chip cookie) to the savory (duck confit sugo).</p> <p>This book is an excellent and intriguing resource for anyone who wants to experiment with cooking, even if you don't consider yourself a geek.</p> <ul> <li>Initialize your kitchen and calibrate your tools </li> <li>Learn about the important reactions in cooking, such as protein denaturation, Maillard reactions, and caramelization, and how they impact the foods we cook </li> <li>Play with your food using hydrocolloids and sous vide cooking </li> <li>Gain firsthand insights from interviews with researchers, food scientists, knife experts, chefs, writers, and more, including author Harold McGee, TV personality Adam Savage, chemist Hervé This, and xkcd </li> </ul> </div> <br> <br> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>From <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>: Butternut Squash Soup</strong> </span>  <p>Purée in a food processor or with an immersion blender:<br> 2 cups (660g) butternut squash, peeled, cubed, and roasted (about 1 medium squash)<br> 2 cups (470g) chicken, turkey, or vegetable stock<br> 1 small (130g) yellow onion, diced and sautéed<br> 1/2 teaspoon (1g) salt (adjust to taste)</p> <p>Notes<uL> <li>The weights are for the prepared ingredients and only rough suggestions. So, prepare each item  individually. For example, for the squash, peel it, then coat it with olive oil, sprinkle it with salt, and  roast it in the oven at a temperature around 400–425 F / 200–220 C until it begins to brown. When you go to  purée the ingredients, hold back some of the squash and some of the stock, taste the purée, and see which  you think it needs. Want it thicker? Add more squash. Thinner? Add more stock.</li> <li>This soup by itself is very basic. Garnish with whatever else you have on hand that you think might go  well, such as garlic croutons and bacon. Or top with a small dab of cream, some toasted walnuts, and dried  cranberries to give it a feeling of Thanksgiving. How about a teaspoon of maple syrup, a few thin slices of  beef, and some fresh oregano? Chives, sour cream, and cheddar cheese? Why not! Instead of purchasing items  to follow a recipe exactly, try using leftover ingredients from other meals to complement the squash  soup.</li> <li>If you’re in a rush, you can “jump-start” the squash by microwaving it first. Peel and quarter the  squash, using a spoon to scoop out the seeds. Then, cube it into 1–2” / 3–5 cm pieces, drop it into a glass  baking pan that’s both oven and microwave safe, and nuke it for four to five minutes to partially heat the  mass. Remove from microwave, coat the squash with olive oil and a light sprinkling of salt, and roast it in  a preheated oven until done, about 20 to 30 minutes. If you’re not in a rush, you can skip the peeling step  entirely: cut the squash in half, scoop out the seeds, add oil and salt, roast it for about an hour (until  the flesh is soft), and use a spoon to scoop it out.</li></ul></p> <span class=\"h1\"> <strong>Pumpkin Cake</strong> </span>  <p> There are two broad types of cake batters: high- ratio cakes--those that have more sugar and water than  flour (or by some definitions, just a lot of sugar)--and low-ratio cakes—which tend to have coarser crumbs.  For high-ratio cakes, there should be more sugar than flour (by weight) and more eggs than fats (again, by  weight), and the liquid mass (eggs, milk, water) should be heavier than the sugar.</p> <p>Consider this pumpkin cake, which is a high-ratio cake (245g of pumpkin contains 220g of water--you can  look these sorts of things up in the USDA National Nutrient Database, available online at  http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/).</p> <p> In a mixing bowl, measure out and then mix with an electric mixer to thoroughly combine:<br> 1 cup (245g) pumpkin (canned, or roast and puree your own)<br> 1 cup (200g) sugar<br> 3/4 cup (160g) canola oil<br> 2 large (120g) eggs<br> 1 1/2 cups (180g) flour<br> 1/4 cup (40g) raisins <br> 2 teaspoons (5g) cinnamon <br> 1 teaspoon (5g) baking powder<br> 1/2 teaspoon (5g) baking soda<br> 1/2 teaspoon (3g) salt<br> 1/2 teaspoon (2g) vanilla extract</p>  <p> Transfer to a greased cake pan or spring form and bake in an oven preheated to 350 F / 175 C until a  toothpick comes out dry, about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Notes<ul> <li>Try adding dried pears soaked in brandy. You can also hold back some of the raisins and sprinkle them  on top.</li> <li>One nice thing about high-ratio cakes is that they don’t have much gluten, so they won’t turn out like  bread, even with excessive beating. With a total weight of 920 grams, of which only roughly 20 grams is  gluten, there just isn’t enough gluten present in this cake to give it a bread-like texture. There’s also a  fair amount of both sugar and fats to interfere with gluten development.</li></ul</p>"

      "For the seventy-fifth anniversary of the <I >Joy of Cooking</I>, Joy comes full circle in a revision based on the 1975 edition which restores the voice of the original authors; focuses on American home cooking, not chef cuisine; and restores many beloved recipes lost in the most recent revision.<br><br>Seventy-five years ago, a St. Louis widow named Irma Rombauer took her life savings and self-published a book called The Joy of Cooking. Her daughter Marion tested recipes and made the illustrations, and they sold their mother-daughter project from Irma's apartment.<BR> <BR>Today, nine revisions later, the <i>Joy of Cooking</i>—selected by The New York Public Library as one of the 150 most important and influential books of the twentieth century—has taught tens of millions of people to cook, helped feed and delight millions beyond that, answered countless kitchen and food questions, and averted many a cooking crisis.<BR> <BR>Ethan Becker, Marion's son, leads the latest generation of JOY, still a family affair, into the twenty-first century with a seventy-fifth anniversary edition that draws upon the best of the past while keeping its eye on the way we cook now. It features a rediscovery of the witty, clear voices of Marion Becker and Irma Rombauer, whose first instructions to the cook were “stand facing the stove.”<BR> <BR>JOY remains the greatest teaching cookbook ever written. Reference material gives cooks the precise information they need for success. New illustrations focus on techniques, including everything from knife skills to splitting cake layers, setting a table, and making tamales.<BR> <BR>This edition also brings back the encyclopedic chapter Know Your Ingredients. The chapter that novices and pros alike have consulted for over thirty years has been revised, expanded, and banded, making it a book within a book. Cooking Methods shows cooks how to braise, steam, roast, sauté, and deep-fry effortlessly, while an all-new Nutrition chapter has the latest thinking on healthy eating—as well as a large dose of common sense.<BR> <BR>This edition restores the personality of the book, reinstating popular elements such as the grab-bag Brunch, Lunch, and Supper chapter and chapters on frozen desserts, cocktails, beer and wine, canning, salting, smoking, jellies and preserves, pickles and relishes, and freezing foods. Fruit recipes bring these favorite ingredients into all courses of the meal, and there is a new grains chart. There are even recipes kids will enjoy making and eating, such as Chocolate Dipped Bananas, Dyed Easter Eggs, and the ever-popular Pizza.<BR> <BR>In addition to hundreds of brand-new recipes, this JOY is filled with many recipes from all previous editions, retested and reinvented for today's tastes.<BR> <BR>This is the JOY for how we live now. Knowing that most cooks are sometimes in a hurry to make a meal, the JOY now has many new dishes ready in thirty minutes or less. Slow cooker recipes have been added for the first time, and Tuna Casserole made with canned cream of mushroom soup is back. This JOY shares how to save time without losing flavor by using quality convenience foods such as canned stocks and broths, beans, tomatoes, and soups, as well as a wide array of frozen ingredients. Cooking creatively with leftovers emphasizes ease and economy, and casseroles—those simple, satisfying, make-ahead, no-fuss dishes -- abound. Especially important to busy households is a new section that teaches how to cook and freeze for a day and eat for a week, in an effort to eat more home-cooked meals, save money, and dine well.<BR> <BR>As always, JOY grows with the times: this edition boasts an expanded Vegetables chapter, including instructions on how to cook vegetables in the microwave, and an expanded baking section, Irma's passion -- always considered a stand-alone bible within the JOY.<BR> <BR>This all-new, all-purpose anniversary edition of the Joy of Cooking offers endless choice for virtually every occasion, situation, and need, from a ten-minute stir-fry on a weekday night to Baby Back Ribs and Grilled Corn in the backyard, or a towering Chocolate Layer Cake with Chocolate Fudge Frosting and Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. JOY will show you the delicious way just as it has done for countless cooks before you.<BR> <BR>Even after seventy-five years, the span of culinary information is breathtaking and covers everything from boiling eggs (there are two schools of thought) to showstopping, celebratory dishes such as Beef Wellington, Roast Turkey and Bread Stuffing, and Crown Roast of Pork.<BR><BR>Happy Anniversary, JOY!"

      "Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. <BR> <BR>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. <BR> <BR>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food."

      "This updated and revised edition of the American Book Award-winner and national bestseller revitalizes the truth of America’s history, explores how myths continue to be perpetrated, and includes a new chapter on 9/11 and the Iraq War.<br><br>Americans have lost touch with their history, and in <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i> Professor James Loewen shows why. After surveying eighteen leading high school American history texts, he has concluded that not one does a decent job of making history interesting or memorable. Marred by an embarrassing combination of blind patriotism, mindless optimism, sheer misinformation, and outright lies, these books omit almost all the ambiguity, passion, conflict, and drama from our past.<BR><BR>In this revised edition, packed with updated material, Loewen explores how historical myths continue to be perpetuated in today's climate and adds an eye-opening chapter on the lies surrounding 9/11 and the Iraq War. From the truth about Columbus's historic voyages to an honest evaluation of our national leaders, Loewen revives our history, restoring the vitality and relevance it truly possesses. <BR><BR>Thought provoking, nonpartisan, and often shocking, Loewen unveils the real America in this iconoclastic classic beloved by high school teachers, history buffs, and enlightened citizens across the country."

      "<p>History isn't always made by great armies colliding or by great civilizations rising or falling. Sometimes it's made when a chauffeur takes a wrong turn, a scientist forgets to clean up his lab, or a drunken soldier gets a bit rowdy. That's the kind of history you'll find in <em>The Greatest Stories Never Told.</em></p><p>This is history candy -- the good stuff. Here are 100 tales to astonish, bewilder, and stupefy: more than two thousand years of history filled with courage, cowardice, hope, triumph, sex, intrigue, folly, humor, and ambition. It's a historical delight and a visual feast with hundreds of photographs, drawings, and maps that bring each story to life. A new discovery waits on every page: stories that changed the course of history and stories that affected what you had for breakfast this morning.</p><p>Consider:</p><ul><li>The Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock because they ran out of beer<li>Some Roman officials were so corrupt that they actually stole time itself<li>Three cigars changed the course of the Civil War<li>The Scottish kilt was invented by an Englishman</ul><p>Based on the popular Timelab 2000® history minutes hosted by Sam Waterston on The History Channel®, this collection of fascinating historical tidbits will have you shaking your head in wonder and disbelief. But they're all true. And you'll soon find yourself telling them to your friends.</p>"

      "Few mixtures are as toxic as absolute power and insanity. When nothing stands between a leader's delusion whims and seeing them carried them out, all sorts of bizarre outcomes are possible.  Whether it is Ottoman Sultan Ibrahim I practicing archery on palace servants and sending out his advisers to find the fattest woman in the empire for his wife or Turkmenistan President Turkmenbashi renaming the days of the week after himself and constructing an 80-foot golden statue that revolves to face the sun, crazed leaders have plagued society for millenia. This book will look at the lives of the ten most mentally unbalanced figures in history. Some suffered from genetic disorders that led to schizophrenia, such as French King Charles VI, who thought he was made of glass. Others believed themselves to be God’s representatives on earth and wrote religious writings that they guaranteed to the reader would get them into heaven, even if they were barely literate.  Whatever their background, these rulers show that dynastic politics made sure that a rightful heir always got on the throne – despite that heir's mental condition – and that power can destroy a mind worse than any mental illness."

      "<b>One of the world’s most beloved writers and bestselling author of <i>One Summer</i> takes his ultimate journey—into the most intriguing and intractable questions that science seeks to answer.<br></b><br>In <i>A Walk in the Woods</i>, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail<b>—</b>well, most of it. In <i>A Sunburned Country</i>, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand<b>—</b>and, if possible, answer<b>—</b>the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything </i>is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining."

      "“It’s a wonderful, splendid book—a book that should be read by every American, student or otherwise, who wants to understand his country, its true history, and its hope for the future.” —Howard Fast, author of <em>Spartacus</em> and <em>The Immigrants</em><p>“[It] should be required reading.” —Eric Foner, <em>New York Times Book Review</em><p>Library Journal calls Howard Zinn’s iconic <em>A People's History of the United States</em> “a brilliant and moving history of the American people from the point of view of those…whose plight has been largely omitted from most histories.” Packed with vivid details and telling quotations, Zinn’s award-winning classic continues to revolutionize the way American history is taught and remembered. Frequent appearances in popular media such as <em>The Sopranos</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Good Will Hunting</em>, and the History Channel documentary <em>The People Speak</em> testify to Zinn’s ability to bridge the generation gap with enduring insights into the birth, development, and destiny of the nation."

      "<p>It's an irresistible combination: Brad Meltzer, a born storyteller, counting down the world's most intriguing unsolved mysteries. And to make this richly illustrated book even richer, each chapter invites the reader along for an interactive experience through the addition of removable facsimile documents—the evidence! It's a treasure trove for conspiracy buffs, a <em>Griffin and Sabine</em> for history lovers.<br /><br />Adapted from <em>Decoded</em>, Meltzer’s hit show on the HISTORY network, <em>History Decoded</em> explores fascinating, unexplained questions. Is Fort Knox empty? Why was Hitler so intent on capturing the Roman “Spear of Destiny”? What’s the government hiding in Area 51? Where did the Confederacy’s $19 million in gold and silver go at the end of the Civil War? And did Lee Harvey Oswald really act alone? Meltzer sifts through the evidence; weighs competing theories;  separates what we know to be true with what’s still—and perhaps forever—unproved or unprovable; and in the end, <em>decodes</em> the mystery, arriving at the most likely solution. Along the way we meet Freemasons, Rosicrucians, Nazi propagandists, and the <em>real</em> DB Cooper.<br /><br />Bound in at the beginning of each story is a custom-designed envelope—a faux 19th-century leather satchel, a U.S. government classified file—containing facsimiles of relevant evidence: John Wilkes Booth’s alleged unsigned will, a map of the Vatican, Kennedy’s death certificate. The whole is a riveting, interactive adventure through the compelling world of mysteries and conspiracies.</p>"

      "This updated and revised edition of the American Book Award-winner and national bestseller revitalizes the truth of America’s history, explores how myths continue to be perpetrated, and includes a new chapter on 9/11 and the Iraq War.<br><br>Americans have lost touch with their history, and in <i>Lies My Teacher Told Me</i> Professor James Loewen shows why. After surveying eighteen leading high school American history texts, he has concluded that not one does a decent job of making history interesting or memorable. Marred by an embarrassing combination of blind patriotism, mindless optimism, sheer misinformation, and outright lies, these books omit almost all the ambiguity, passion, conflict, and drama from our past.<BR><BR>In this revised edition, packed with updated material, Loewen explores how historical myths continue to be perpetuated in today's climate and adds an eye-opening chapter on the lies surrounding 9/11 and the Iraq War. From the truth about Columbus's historic voyages to an honest evaluation of our national leaders, Loewen revives our history, restoring the vitality and relevance it truly possesses. <BR><BR>Thought provoking, nonpartisan, and often shocking, Loewen unveils the real America in this iconoclastic classic beloved by high school teachers, history buffs, and enlightened citizens across the country."

      "<p>History isn't always made by great armies colliding or by great civilizations rising or falling. Sometimes it's made when a chauffeur takes a wrong turn, a scientist forgets to clean up his lab, or a drunken soldier gets a bit rowdy. That's the kind of history you'll find in <em>The Greatest Stories Never Told.</em></p><p>This is history candy -- the good stuff. Here are 100 tales to astonish, bewilder, and stupefy: more than two thousand years of history filled with courage, cowardice, hope, triumph, sex, intrigue, folly, humor, and ambition. It's a historical delight and a visual feast with hundreds of photographs, drawings, and maps that bring each story to life. A new discovery waits on every page: stories that changed the course of history and stories that affected what you had for breakfast this morning.</p><p>Consider:</p><ul><li>The Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock because they ran out of beer<li>Some Roman officials were so corrupt that they actually stole time itself<li>Three cigars changed the course of the Civil War<li>The Scottish kilt was invented by an Englishman</ul><p>Based on the popular Timelab 2000® history minutes hosted by Sam Waterston on The History Channel®, this collection of fascinating historical tidbits will have you shaking your head in wonder and disbelief. But they're all true. And you'll soon find yourself telling them to your friends.</p>"

      "Few mixtures are as toxic as absolute power and insanity. When nothing stands between a leader's delusion whims and seeing them carried them out, all sorts of bizarre outcomes are possible.  Whether it is Ottoman Sultan Ibrahim I practicing archery on palace servants and sending out his advisers to find the fattest woman in the empire for his wife or Turkmenistan President Turkmenbashi renaming the days of the week after himself and constructing an 80-foot golden statue that revolves to face the sun, crazed leaders have plagued society for millenia. This book will look at the lives of the ten most mentally unbalanced figures in history. Some suffered from genetic disorders that led to schizophrenia, such as French King Charles VI, who thought he was made of glass. Others believed themselves to be God’s representatives on earth and wrote religious writings that they guaranteed to the reader would get them into heaven, even if they were barely literate.  Whatever their background, these rulers show that dynastic politics made sure that a rightful heir always got on the throne – despite that heir's mental condition – and that power can destroy a mind worse than any mental illness."

      "<b>One of the world’s most beloved writers and bestselling author of <i>One Summer</i> takes his ultimate journey—into the most intriguing and intractable questions that science seeks to answer.<br></b><br>In <i>A Walk in the Woods</i>, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail<b>—</b>well, most of it. In <i>A Sunburned Country</i>, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand<b>—</b>and, if possible, answer<b>—</b>the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world’s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything </i>is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining."

      "“It’s a wonderful, splendid book—a book that should be read by every American, student or otherwise, who wants to understand his country, its true history, and its hope for the future.” —Howard Fast, author of <em>Spartacus</em> and <em>The Immigrants</em><p>“[It] should be required reading.” —Eric Foner, <em>New York Times Book Review</em><p>Library Journal calls Howard Zinn’s iconic <em>A People's History of the United States</em> “a brilliant and moving history of the American people from the point of view of those…whose plight has been largely omitted from most histories.” Packed with vivid details and telling quotations, Zinn’s award-winning classic continues to revolutionize the way American history is taught and remembered. Frequent appearances in popular media such as <em>The Sopranos</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Good Will Hunting</em>, and the History Channel documentary <em>The People Speak</em> testify to Zinn’s ability to bridge the generation gap with enduring insights into the birth, development, and destiny of the nation."

      "<p>It's an irresistible combination: Brad Meltzer, a born storyteller, counting down the world's most intriguing unsolved mysteries. And to make this richly illustrated book even richer, each chapter invites the reader along for an interactive experience through the addition of removable facsimile documents—the evidence! It's a treasure trove for conspiracy buffs, a <em>Griffin and Sabine</em> for history lovers.<br /><br />Adapted from <em>Decoded</em>, Meltzer’s hit show on the HISTORY network, <em>History Decoded</em> explores fascinating, unexplained questions. Is Fort Knox empty? Why was Hitler so intent on capturing the Roman “Spear of Destiny”? What’s the government hiding in Area 51? Where did the Confederacy’s $19 million in gold and silver go at the end of the Civil War? And did Lee Harvey Oswald really act alone? Meltzer sifts through the evidence; weighs competing theories;  separates what we know to be true with what’s still—and perhaps forever—unproved or unprovable; and in the end, <em>decodes</em> the mystery, arriving at the most likely solution. Along the way we meet Freemasons, Rosicrucians, Nazi propagandists, and the <em>real</em> DB Cooper.<br /><br />Bound in at the beginning of each story is a custom-designed envelope—a faux 19th-century leather satchel, a U.S. government classified file—containing facsimiles of relevant evidence: John Wilkes Booth’s alleged unsigned will, a map of the Vatican, Kennedy’s death certificate. The whole is a riveting, interactive adventure through the compelling world of mysteries and conspiracies.</p>"
