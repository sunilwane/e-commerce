      "Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV. Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life. <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V is the largest and most ambitious game Rockstar Games has yet created, and takes full advantage of every ounce of processing power available in the current generation of consoles.  In order to provide the best possible experience for such a massive and detailed world, the game will have installation requirements on the Xbox 360.  <br /> <br /> Grand Theft Auto V will ship on two discs; Disc 1 will be used for a one-time mandatory install and Disc 2 will be used to play the game. After the install, players will be able to enjoy both Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online without any need to switch discs. <br /> <br />This initial install will require an Xbox 360 Hard Drive or an external 16GB USB flash drive (sold separately) with at least 8 GB of free space. If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance. "

      "<span>Getting an MBA is an expensive choice-one almost impossible to justify regardless of the state of the economy. Even the elite schools like Harvard and Wharton offer outdated, assembly-line programs that teach you more about PowerPoint presentations and unnecessary financial models than what it takes to run a real business. You can get better results (and save hundreds of thousands of dollars) by skipping business school altogether. </span><br><br><span>Josh Kaufman founded PersonalMBA.com as an alternative to the business school boondoggle. His blog has introduced hundreds of thousands of readers to the best business books and most powerful business concepts of all time. Now, he shares the essentials of entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, negotiation, operations, productivity, systems design, and much more, in one comprehensive volume. </span><span><i>The Personal MBA</i></span><span> distills the most valuable business lessons into simple, memorable mental models that can be applied to real-world challenges. </span><br><br><span>The Personal MBA</span><span> explains concepts such as: </span><span></span><div><ul><li><span><b>The Iron Law of the Market</b>: Why every business is limited by the size and quality of the market it attempts to serve-and how to find large, hungry markets. </span></li><li><span><b>The 12 Forms of Value</b>: Products and services are only two of the twelve ways you can create value for your customers. </span></li><li><span><b>The Pricing Uncertainty Principle</b>: All prices are malleable. Raising your prices is the best way to dramatically increase profitability - if you know how to support the price you're asking. </span></li><li><span><b>4 Methods to Increase Revenue</b>: There are only four ways a business can bring in more money. Do you know what they are? </span></li></ul></div><div><span>True leaders aren't made by business schools - they make themselves, seeking out the knowledge, skills, and experience they need to succeed. Read this book and you will learn the principles it takes most business professionals a lifetime of trial and error to master.</span></div>"

      "<i>Business Model Generation</i> is a handbook for visionaries, game changers, and challengers striving to defy outmoded business models and design tomorrow's enterprises. If your organization needs to adapt to harsh new realities, but you don't yet have a strategy that will get you out in front of your competitors, you need <i>Business Model Generation</i>.   <p/>   Co-created by 470 \"Business Model Canvas\" practitioners from 45 countries, the book features a beautiful, highly visual, 4-color design that takes powerful strategic ideas and tools, and makes them easy to implement in your organization. It explains the most common Business Model patterns, based on concepts from leading business thinkers, and helps you reinterpret them for your own context. You will learn how to systematically understand, design, and implement a game-changing business model--or analyze and renovate an old one. Along the way, you'll understand at a much deeper level your customers, distribution channels, partners, revenue streams, costs, and your core value proposition.   <p/>   <i>Business Model Generation</i> features practical innovation techniques used today by leading consultants and companies worldwide, including 3M, Ericsson, Capgemini, Deloitte, and others. Designed for doers, it is for those ready to abandon outmoded thinking and embrace new models of value creation: for executives, consultants, entrepreneurs, and leaders of all organizations. If you're ready to change the rules, you belong to \"the business model generation!\" <p/>"

      "<span>Getting an MBA is an expensive choice-one almost impossible to justify regardless of the state of the economy. Even the elite schools like Harvard and Wharton offer outdated, assembly-line programs that teach you more about PowerPoint presentations and unnecessary financial models than what it takes to run a real business. You can get better results (and save hundreds of thousands of dollars) by skipping business school altogether. </span><br><br><span>Josh Kaufman founded PersonalMBA.com as an alternative to the business school boondoggle. His blog has introduced hundreds of thousands of readers to the best business books and most powerful business concepts of all time. Now, he shares the essentials of entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, negotiation, operations, productivity, systems design, and much more, in one comprehensive volume. </span><span><i>The Personal MBA</i></span><span> distills the most valuable business lessons into simple, memorable mental models that can be applied to real-world challenges. </span><br><br><span>The Personal MBA</span><span> explains concepts such as: </span><span></span><div><ul><li><span><b>The Iron Law of the Market</b>: Why every business is limited by the size and quality of the market it attempts to serve-and how to find large, hungry markets. </span></li><li><span><b>The 12 Forms of Value</b>: Products and services are only two of the twelve ways you can create value for your customers. </span></li><li><span><b>The Pricing Uncertainty Principle</b>: All prices are malleable.

Do you know what they are? </span></li></ul></div><div><span>True leaders aren't made by business schools - they make themselves, seeking out the knowledge, skills, and experience they need to succeed.

      "<span>Getting an MBA is an expensive choice-one almost impossible to justify regardless of the state of the economy. Even the elite schools like Harvard and Wharton offer outdated, assembly-line programs that teach you more about PowerPoint presentations and unnecessary financial models than what it takes to run a real business. You can get better results (and save hundreds of thousands of dollars) by skipping business school altogether. </span><br><br><span>Josh Kaufman founded PersonalMBA.com as an alternative to the business school boondoggle. His blog has introduced hundreds of thousands of readers to the best business books and most powerful business concepts of all time. Now, he shares the essentials of entrepreneurship, marketing, sales, negotiation, operations, productivity, systems design, and much more, in one comprehensive volume. </span><span><i>The Personal MBA</i></span><span> distills the most valuable business lessons into simple, memorable mental models that can be applied to real-world challenges. </span><br><br><span>The Personal MBA</span><span> explains concepts such as: </span><span></span><div><ul><li><span><b>The Iron Law of the Market</b>: Why every business is limited by the size and quality of the market it attempts to serve-and how to find large, hungry markets. </span></li><li><span><b>The 12 Forms of Value</b>: Products and services are only two of the twelve ways you can create value for your customers. </span></li><li><span><b>The Pricing Uncertainty Principle</b>: All prices are malleable. Raising your prices is the best way to dramatically increase profitability - if you know how to support the price you're asking. </span></li><li><span><b>4 Methods to Increase Revenue</b>: There are only four ways a business can bring in more money. Do you know what they are? </span></li></ul></div><div><span>True leaders aren't made by business schools - they make themselves, seeking out the knowledge, skills, and experience they need to succeed. Read this book and you will learn the principles it takes most business professionals a lifetime of trial and error to master.</span></div>"
